    Sun of the фцкsleepless! Melaвncholy star!
Whose tearfхul bыкупквaфцm glows tremulously far,
That show’st the darkыness thou canфыst not dispel,
How like art thаou to joy re

member’d well!

    So gleams the past, the a
flight of other days,
Which shines, but warms nпot with its powerless rays
;
A night-beamп Soпвкrrow
 watcheth to behold,
Distinct, buфвывt d
паistantа — clear, but oh, how cold!
